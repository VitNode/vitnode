## FAQ

import { Accordion, Accordions } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/accordion';

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Why VitNode?">
  `VitNode` is for developers who want to create websites with ease without worrying about the basic staff like authentication, authorization, database, emails etc.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why not VitNode?">
    If you want to create simple static page with no backend, `VitNode` is not for
    you. You can use only [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) or [Astro](https://astro.build/) for that.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why NestJS insted of NextJS api?">
    The goal of `VitNode` is to provide a full-stack solution for developers to
    create websites with ease.

    `NextJS API` don't have a lot of features that `NestJS` have, like guards, interceptors, pipes, dependency injection, decorators, WebSockets, dynamic saving files etc.

    `NestJS` is a great framework for building APIs and `NextJS` is a great framework for building websites. Combining these two frameworks allows developers to create websites with ease.

  </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="When VitNode will be stable?">
    Not earlier then `NestJS 15` and `React 19` will be stable.
