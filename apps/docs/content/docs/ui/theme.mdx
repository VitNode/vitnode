VitNode uses [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) in frontend with `app` directory. You can create own components like normal NextJS project. We have only few things about `routing` inside `app` directory that you need to know.

## Short Rules

Before we start, here are some short rules that you need to know:

- Do not touch `(vitnode)` folders, they are used by VitNode,
- You can overwrite any pages from `(vitnode)` folder by creating own pages,
- Create files only inside `[locale]` directory.

## Overwrite Pages

VitNode uses [Catch-all Segments](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments) to handle prebuild pages. That means you can overwrite any pages by creating own pages with same name.

For example, if you want to change `login` page, you can create `login/page.tsx` inside `app/[locale]/` directory.

```tsx title="apps/frontend/app/[locale]/login/page.tsx"
export default function Page() {
  return <div>Login Page</div>;
}
```

That will overwrite page and you will see `Login Page` without any layouts.

<Callout title="Do not overwrite Admin Pages" type="warn">
  Avoid changing pre-build pages like `admin/core` or `admin/members`. You can
  do it, but you will lose some features.

### Layouts

We have a few pre-build layouts that you can use for your pages.

- `app/[locale]` - Empty layout,
- `app/[locale]/(main)` - Main layout for all pages with header, footer, sidebar etc.,
- `app/[locale]/admin` - Protected layout for admin pages who need authentication with AdminCP,
- `app/[locale]/admin/(auth)` - Main layout for admin pages with header, footer, sidebar etc.

### Pre-Build Components

Our pre-build components are located inside `vitnode-frontend` package. You can use them in your pages.

#### Choose a page to change

As an example how to change the `login` page and keep functionality to sign in. This example you can use also in other pages.

#### Find view on GitHub

All views are located in [`packages/frontend/src/views/theme/views`](https://github.com/VitNode/vitnode/tree/canary/packages/frontend/src/views/theme/views) directory in [VitNode Github](https://github.com/VitNode/vitnode/tree/canary/packages/frontend/src/views/theme/views).

In our example we want to change the `login` page. You can find it in [`auth/sign/in/sign-in-view.tsx`](https://github.com/VitNode/vitnode/blob/canary/packages/frontend/src/views/theme/views/auth/sign/in/sign-in-view.tsx).

  You can ask for help in our [GitHub
  Issues](https://github.com/VitNode/vitnode/issues). We are happy to help you
  with your problem.

#### Change the view

You can copy the view to your project and change it as you want.

For example I don't want the header of card, so I will replace it to something alse.

```tsx title="apps/frontend/app/[locale]/login/page.tsx"
import { FormSignIn } from 'vitnode-frontend/views/theme/views/auth/sign/in/form/form-sign-in';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div className="container my-10 flex max-w-5xl flex-wrap gap-10">
      <div className="flex-1">Something here</div>

      <FormSignIn />
    </div>
  );
}
```

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout title="Watch cerfuly our Releases" type="warn">
  When you update VitNode, you need to watch our
  [Releases](https://github.com/VitNode/vitnode/releases) if you import some
  logic components from package. We can change it and you will need to update
  your views in your project. Otherwise you may have some problems.
</Callout>

## Plugins

### Pages & Layouts

When you create a plugin, VitNode will automatically export all pages and layouts from the folders with your plugin code.

For example, if you create a plugin with name `myplugin`, you can create pages inside `app/[locale]/myplugin/` directory nad `app/[locale]/myplugin/(main)` layout.

When you run tool to `download` plugin from AdminCP, all pages and layouts will be downloaded to your project and save it inside zipped file.

### Default Page

As default plugins doesn't have a default page. To create a default page, you need to create `default-page.tsx` inside `plugins/${your_plugin}/` directory.

```tsx title="apps/frontend/plugins/myplugin/default-page.tsx"
export default function Page() {
  return <div>Default Page for My Plugin</div>;
}
```

After created default page, you can set as default plugin in AdminCP and it will be displayed as default page for your plugin.
