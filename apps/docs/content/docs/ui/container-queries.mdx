title: Containter Queries
description: Container queries are a new way to build responsive designs that are aware of their container's size and shape.
---

We added Talwind CSS plugin - [@tailwindcss/container-queries](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-container-queries) to support container queries. You don't need to do anything to enable it, it's already enabled by default and ready to use.

## Usage

Start by marking an element as a container using the `@container` class, and then applying styles based on the size of that container using the container variants like `@md:`, `@lg:`, and `@xl:`:

```tsx
export const Example = () => {
  return (
    <div className="@container">
      <div className="@lg:underline">
        // This text will be underlined when the container is larger than
        `32rem`
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Named containers

You can optionally name containers using a `@container/{name}` class, and then include that name in the container variants using classes like `@lg/{name}:underline`:

```tsx
export const Example = () => {
  return (
    <div className="@container/main">
      something
      <div className="@lg/main:underline">
        // This text will be underlined when the "main" container is larger than
        `32rem`
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Arbitrary container sizes

In addition to using one of the [container sizes](#configuration) provided by default, you can also create one-off sizes using any arbitrary value:

```tsx
export const Example = () => {
  return (
    <div className="@container">
      <div className="@[17.5rem]:underline">
        // This text will be underlined when the container is larger than
        `17.5rem`
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Removing a container

To stop an element from acting as a container, use the `@container-normal` class.

```tsx
export const Example = () => {
  return <div className="@container xl:@container-normal">something</div>;
};
```

### With a prefix

If you have configured Tailwind to use a prefix, make sure to prefix both the `@container` class and any classes where you are using a container query modifier:

```tsx
export const Example = () => {
  return (
    <div className="tw-@container">
      something
      <div className="@lg:tw-underline">something</div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Configuration

By default we ship with the following configured values:

| Name   | CSS                                          |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `@xs`  | `@container (min-width: 20rem /* 320px */)`  |
| `@sm`  | `@container (min-width: 24rem /* 384px */)`  |
| `@md`  | `@container (min-width: 28rem /* 448px */)`  |
| `@lg`  | `@container (min-width: 32rem /* 512px */)`  |
| `@xl`  | `@container (min-width: 36rem /* 576px */)`  |
| `@2xl` | `@container (min-width: 42rem /* 672px */)`  |
| `@3xl` | `@container (min-width: 48rem /* 768px */)`  |
| `@4xl` | `@container (min-width: 56rem /* 896px */)`  |
| `@5xl` | `@container (min-width: 64rem /* 1024px */)` |
| `@6xl` | `@container (min-width: 72rem /* 1152px */)` |
| `@7xl` | `@container (min-width: 80rem /* 1280px */)` |
