The most pawerful feature of VitNode is the ability to create plugins. Plugins are a way to extend the functionality of VitNode.

## Create a Plugin

<Callout title="Development Mode" type="warn">
  To create plugins, you need to enable the development mode. [See more
  here](/docs/dev#developemnt-server).
</Callout>

import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';
 
<Steps>
<Step>
 
### AdminCP

In VitNode we create plugins by going to `AdminCP > Plugins`. System will create all required files and folders for the plugin including the `default-page.tsx` file which is the main file of the plugin.

Click on the `Create Plugin` button to create a new plugin.

import { ImageZoom } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/image-zoom';
import formCreatePlugin from '@/assets/ui/plugins/form-create-plugin.png';

<ImageZoom src={formCreatePlugin} className="max-w-xs" alt="test" />
 
</Step>
 
<Step>
 
### Provide Information

Fill the form with the required information:

- **Name**: The name of the plugin,
- **Description**: A short description of the plugin,
- **Code**: Unique code for the plugin,
- **Support URL**: The URL where users can get support for the plugin.
- **Author**: The author of the plugin,
- **Author URL**: The URL of the author.

<ImageZoom src={formCreatePlugin} className="max-w-xs" alt="test" />

<Callout title="Unique Code" type="warn">
The code must be unique and can't be changed later. It's used to identify the plugin.

Best practice is to use the author's name and the plugin name as the code. For example, `john-doe-my-plugin`.

</Callout>
 
</Step>
<Step>

### Test Plugin

After creating the plugin, you can test it by making this plugin as the default plugin. Click on the `Set as Default` button.

<ImageZoom src={formCreatePlugin} className="max-w-xs" alt="test" />

</Step>

</Steps>

## Developer Tools

VitNode provides a set of tools to help you develop plugins faster. Go to `AdminCP > Plugins` and click on the `Developer Tools` button inside the plugin.

<ImageZoom src={formCreatePlugin} className="max-w-xs" alt="test" />
