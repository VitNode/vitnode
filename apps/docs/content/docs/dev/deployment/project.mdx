## Envs

When you're used `create-vitnode-app` to create a new project, you can find the `.env` file in the root of your project. This file contains the environment variables that are used by the project.

### LOGIN_TOKEN_SECRET

This is the secret key used to sign the JWT token for the user session. It is recommended to use a long random string for this value.

<Callout title="Don't change LOGIN_TOKEN_SECRET later!" type="error">
  If you change this value after the project has been deployed, all existing
  user sessions will be invalidated.
</Callout>

```bash title=".env"
LOGIN_TOKEN_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

### NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL

This is the URL of the backend server that the frontend will connect to. This value is used by the frontend to make API requests to the backend.

```bash title=".env"
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

### Database

```bash title=".env"
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=root
# DB_HOST=database
# DB_DATABASE=vitnode
# DB_PORT=5432
# DB_SSL=false
```

<Callout title="Optional envs">Commented envs are optional.</Callout>
