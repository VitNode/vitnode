## FAQ

import { Accordion, Accordions } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/accordion';

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Why NestJS insted of NextJS api?">
    The goal of `VitNode` is to provide a full-stack solution for developers to
    create websites with ease.

    `NextJS API` don't have a lot of features that `NestJS` have, like guards, interceptors, pipes, dependency injection, decorators, WebSockets, dynamic saving files etc.

    `NestJS` is a great framework for building APIs and `NextJS` is a great framework for building websites. Combining these two frameworks allows developers to create websites with ease.
