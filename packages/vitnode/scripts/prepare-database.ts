 * Opens the connection the migration lock is held on, or `null`.
 *
 * ## Why this is a connection of its own
 *
 * An advisory lock belongs to a *session*, so the lock has to be taken and
 * released on one connection that stays open for the whole bootstrap. The
 * obvious way to get one is `postgres`' own `reserve()`, which pins a connection
 * out of the application's pool - and that is exactly what this used to do, and
 * it deadlocks.
 *
 * The pool has a size. `drizzle({ connection })` passes an app's options through
 * to `postgres`, so `max: 1` is a configuration a VitNode app is entitled to
 * have - a serverless function or a small container has every reason to. With
 * `max: 1`, `reserve()` takes the only connection there is; `runMigrations` then
 * asks the same pool for one to migrate on, and waits for a connection that
 * cannot be returned until the migration it is blocking has finished. Nothing
 * times out and nothing errors: the terminal simply stops.
 *
 * So the lock gets a connection the pool does not know about, and every pooled
 * connection stays available for the work being serialised. The bootstrap then
 * needs exactly one application connection, which is the smallest pool anybody
 * can configure.
 *
 * ## Why it is built from the app's own options
 *
 * `sql.options` is `postgres`' parsed connection configuration and part of its
 * public surface (`Sql.options: ParsedOptions`). Handing it back to `postgres()`
 * is supported by construction - `parseOptions` returns an already-parsed object
 * untouched - so the lock connects to the same database, as the same user, with
 * the same TLS settings and the same custom socket as the application, without
 * this code knowing what any of those are. Nothing is re-derived from an
 * environment variable, which is what would break the moment an app built its
 * `dbProvider` from something other than `POSTGRES_URL`.
 *
 * Four fields are overridden, and each is about this connection being
 * short-lived and solitary: one connection, no idle recycling while the lock is
 * held, its own server-parameter and type caches rather than the application's,
 * and a recognisable `application_name`.
 *
 * ## When there is no lock
 *
 * A driver whose client carries no such options runs unlocked rather than
 * failing. VitNode supports whatever `dbProvider` an app configures, and
 * refusing to migrate on one this cannot introspect would be a worse outcome
 * than the race it avoids - which, for the single-process case that every
 * non-monorepo app has, does not exist anyway.

 * The `core_languages` rows an API config asks for.

 *
 * ## What it replaced
 *
 * The seed read the *frontend* config - `getConfig({ type: "config" })`, which
 * walks the working directory looking for a `src/vitnode.config.ts`. Run from
 * the app that owns the schema, which in this repository and in every generated
 * monorepo is the API, there is no such file to find: the web app's config is a
 * sibling the search never reaches. So the lookup returned `null`, the fallback
 * ran, and a fresh database came up with `en` and nothing else - however many
 * languages the installation actually serves. `pl` was missing from
 * `core_languages`, and everything keyed on a language row - translations,
 * localized content, the AdminCP's language switcher - had nowhere to put it.
 *
 * A database bootstrap discovering a *frontend* by walking the filesystem was
 * the mistake underneath the symptom. The API config is the one this command
 * already loads, an installation declares its languages once and points both
 * configs at that declaration, and nothing here looks for a sibling app.
 *
 * ## The rules
 *
 * - No `i18n`, or no locales: {@link DEFAULT_SEED_LANGUAGES}. The API's own
 *   locale list is derived from what the installed packages ship when it has no
 *   block, which is not a statement about what the *site* offers - so seeding
 *   from it would write a language row per installed translation.
 * - `enabled: false` is dropped, matching `localeRoutingFromConfig`: a language
 *   the app has switched off should 404 rather than get a row that makes it
 *   selectable in the AdminCP. If that leaves nothing, the default list stands.
 * - `default` and `protected` mark `defaultLocale`, which falls back to `"en"`
 *   exactly as the API runtime's does, and then to the first configured locale
 *   when the app does not serve `en` at all - a database with no default
 *   language is not a state anything downstream can read.
 * - `timeZone` is the installation's, for every row.

/**
 * `vitnode db:prepare` - everything a database needs before anything serves a
 * request.
 *
 * Awaited to completion by whatever starts a dev server, and that sequencing is
 * the point rather than a detail. Serialised by
 * {@link withMigrationLock}, because more than one runtime legitimately gates on
 * it: the API and any single app that mounts the API both need the schema before
 * they start, and a monorepo `turbo dev` launches them at once. Run concurrently with `vite dev` or
 * `tsx watch`, a bootstrap turns every fresh checkout into a race: the first
 * requests hit a schema that is still being built, and what a developer sees is
 * an arbitrary Postgres error from a page rather than a migration log from their
 * terminal. So this resolves or it throws, and the caller starts nothing until it
 * has resolved.
 *
 * ## What it is not
 *
 * It was `vitnode init` until Stage 17, and the rename is not cosmetic. That
 * command had two responsibilities bolted together: it prepared the database,
 * and - through `preparePluginsFiles` - it copied every installed plugin's pages
 * into the host app so the host could see them. Removing the copier removed the
 * reason `init` was called `init`, and left a command whose name promised a
 * project-wide setup while doing one thing.
 *
 * A plugin's routes are compiled into a literal registry by the app's own Vite
 * plugin now, on every dev start and every build. Nothing here prepares a
 * plugin, nothing here writes a route file, and nothing here knows what a plugin
 * is. See `@vitnode/core/framework/vite`.
 *
 * `--web` is gone with it. A web app that talks to a separate API owns no
 * schema, so the honest answer is for its `dev` script not to call this at all
 * rather than for this to accept a flag meaning "do nothing".
