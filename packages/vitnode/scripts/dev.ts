/**
 * `vitnode dev` - a plugin's own build, in watch mode.
 *
 * Three compilers over the plugin's `src/`, and nothing else. This also used to
 * start a chokidar watcher that copied the plugin's
 * `src/routes/{main,admin,blank,breadcrumb}/` into every host app on every save,
 * rewriting each import as it went - so a plugin page existed twice and the copy
 * was the one that ran.
 *
 * An app now reads a plugin's routes out of its `dist` through the generated
 * route registry, which is why watching `dist` is the whole job: `swc -w`
 * writes the page, the app's Vite server sees the file it already imports
 * change, and the page reloads. Nothing is copied and nothing has to be cleaned
 * up when a route file is deleted.
