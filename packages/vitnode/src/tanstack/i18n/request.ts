/**
 * Everything about a request's locale that has to be decided before rendering.
 *
 * Three jobs, in order:
 *
 * 1. **Remembering an explicit choice.** Arriving at `/pl/...` *is* a statement
 *    about language, so it updates the cookie that `/admin` reads. Arriving at
 *    an unprefixed URL is not: `/discover` is English because English is the
 *    default, not because the visitor chose it, and overwriting a stored `pl`
 *    with `en` on every such visit would quietly undo the switcher.
 *
 * 2. **Canonicalisation.** `/en` and `/en/discover` are the default locale
 *    written out longhand; the URLs an app serves are `/` and `/discover`.
 *    Two URLs for one page splits its ranking, its cache entries and its share
 *    links, so the long form redirects permanently to the short one - query
 *    string and hash intact.
 *
 * 3. **Stripping ignored paths.** `/pl/admin` is a locale prefix in front of a
 *    route that never carries one, so it redirects to `/admin`.
 *
 * The order of the first two matters, and getting it wrong is invisible.
 * `/pl/admin` is both an explicit choice *and* a redirect, and the redirect is
 * the end of the request - so the cookie has to be attached to it. Deciding the
 * redirect first and the cookie afterwards means the browser follows `/admin`
 * carrying nothing, `/admin` finds no stored preference, and the language the
 * visitor just asked for by URL is gone before the page they asked for renders.
 *
 * `/api/*` gets none of it - see {@link isApiPath} and `shouldIgnoreLocalePath`.
 *
 * 308 rather than 301: both are permanent and both are treated the same by
 * search engines, but 308 is the one that forbids a client from replaying the
 * request as a `GET`. Nothing under a locale prefix is a form post today; if one
 * ever is, this stays correct instead of silently dropping its body.
 *
 * `localeRouting` is handed in rather than read from the registered runtime,
 * because this runs in the host's global request middleware - which Start
 * executes before route matching and therefore before anything else in this
 * namespace has necessarily been reached. An explicit argument makes that
 * ordering a fact of the call rather than a hope about module evaluation.
