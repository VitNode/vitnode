 * registers through `configureIntl`, so loading the strings is this module's
 * job again.

 *
 * Standalone, and it takes no metadata, because it needs none: a panel's *title*
 * is a translated string and the site name is appended later, by whichever
 * `head` renders it. {@link createSettingsPanel} re-exports this one rather than
