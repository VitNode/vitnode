        The shared list, handed the two things it cannot resolve for itself:
        the devices, and the revoke.

        The revoke goes straight from the browser to Hono - no server function in
        between, because it needs no server-only secret and sets no cookie - and
        ends in an invalidation of the one `devices/me` entry, but only when the
        list is actually wrong. A `429` or a `401` left it exactly as it was, and
        refetching would send the same read back into whatever refused the first.
