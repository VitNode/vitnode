 *    `"seo.title"` columns;
 * 2. batch-load the collections - and only the ones the allowlist actually
 *    exposes, because querying a private junction table to discard its rows
 *    afterwards is work with no answer attached;
 * 3. attach them to their rows;
 * 4. batch-resolve the file fields **last**, because a `multiple: true` file
 *    field has no column: its identifiers only exist on the row once
 *    `loadMany` has put them there.
 *
 * One batch per page either way. Shared by the localized public service and the
 * plain one, whose statements and localization strategies are deliberately
 * different but whose hydration is the same work.
