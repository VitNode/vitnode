 * `fetchPage` is the seam. It defaults to the browser's fetcher, which is what
 * a hydrated page wants; an app that also fetches during SSR passes one that
 * can do both. It is a plain async function rather than anything
 * framework-shaped, so nothing about this module knows which framework is
 * rendering it.
 *
 * `initialData` is for a server that already has page one in hand and no cache
 * to put it in. A framework that hydrates a real Query cache must **not** use
 * it: the
 * page is already in the entry this key names, and passing it again is a second
 * copy of the same bytes that can disagree with the first.
 *
 * No `staleTime`. Freshness is whatever the API's own caching gives, plus
 * VitNode's client defaults (`refetchOnMount` and `refetchOnWindowFocus` both
 * off), so a hydrated feed is not refetched behind the reader.
