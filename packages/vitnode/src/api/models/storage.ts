   * Removes a stored file by its `core_files` id.

   * **Database first, blob second**, and the order is the whole point. A Content
   * Engine file column references this table with `ON DELETE RESTRICT`, and so
   * does every retained revision's file pin - so the `DELETE` is what asks
   * Postgres "is anything still using this?", and it is the only thing that can
   * answer correctly under concurrency. Deleting the object first, as this used
   * to, meant a referenced file lost its bytes and *then* had its removal
   * refused: the article survived, pointing at a 404.
   *
   * The two things that can hold a file are **not** the same thing, and this
   * says which one did:
   *
   * - a **live** reference - a content column, or a gallery's junction row - is
   *   a page that would break. Refused, always: `409 FILE_IN_USE` with
   *   `content: true`, and no `force` gets past it.
   * - a **retained revision's pin** is history. Refused by default too, but with
   *   `content: false` and the number of revisions holding it, so the caller can
   *   ask again with `force` - which drops those pins and lets the file go.
   *
   * Without that second door the Files screen is a dead end: a cover image
   * swapped once is pinned by the revision that recorded the swap, and retention
   * only prunes when that *same record* is written again - so a file nothing
   * displays any more stays undeletable, quite possibly for ever.
   *
   * Everything else is unchanged: row removed -> the object is deleted,
   * best-effort (a missing object must not fail a delete that already
   * committed); no such row -> 404.
   *
   * An orphaned storage object is the failure this prefers. It costs disk; a
   * content record pointing at bytes that are gone costs a broken page nobody
   * can repair from the AdminCP.
   *
   * Pass `ownerId` to scope the delete to that user's own uploads.
