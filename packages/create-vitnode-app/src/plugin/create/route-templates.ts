 * import of this tree, and nothing else.
 *
 * Add a route by adding a \`page()\`. \`path\` is the public URL, written in
 * VitNode's own spelling: a dynamic segment is \`:id\`, never Next's \`[id]\` and
 * never TanStack's \`$id\`. To nest pages inside a shared frame, wrap them in a
 * \`layout()\` and give each child a path relative to it.
