// and imported by whichever app installed it - so a type-level dependency on
// one host's framework is one every installing app inherits. `use-intl` must be
// a direct dependency of this package for the reference above to resolve under
// pnpm's strict `node_modules`.
//
// A plugin can render on both sides (UI components and, e.g., emails), so it
// types keys against both of core's trees. Add your own server tree here too
// (`./src/locales/api/en.json`) once your plugin sends email.
