# Domain

Your first step to install VitNode is to choose a domain name for your website.

## Register a domain

_(If you have already a domain, you can skip this step)_

You can register a domain name with any domain registrar. For example we use [Google Domains](https://domains.google/).

## Configure DNS

We recommend using Cloudflare as your DNS provider, but if you don't want to use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), you can use any other DNS provider or connect DNS directly to your server.

<Steps>

### Create an Cloudflare account

Create an account on [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) or log in if you already have an account.

### Add a site

Add your domain to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). You can do this by clicking on the "Add a site" button and following the instructions.

### Add records

You need to add `A` records and point it to your server's IP address for `frontend` and `backend` domains.

For example, if your domain is `vitnode.com`, you can add the following records:

<Image src={dnsCf} alt="DNS Records in CloudFlare" />

That created:

- frontend.vitnode.com
- backend.vitnode.com

If you don't want to use subdomains, you can add `@` for the name of the record and point it to your server's IP address for frontend. If you want to redirect from `www` to `non-www` add `www` for the name of the record and point it to your server's IP address for frontend.

/>

Make sure that the proxy status is set to `Proxied` for your domain.

</Steps>

## SSL Certificate

You need to install an SSL certificate to enable HTTPS on your domain.

If you are using [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), you can use Cloudflare's SSL certificate and following the instructions below.

<Steps>

### Open panel for your domain

Open the panel for your domain on [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

### SSL/TLS

Go to the "SSL/TLS => `Overview`" tab and make sure that the SSL certificate is set to `Full (strict)`, `Full` or `Flexible`.

### Always use HTTPS

Go to the "SSL/TLS => `Edge Certificates`" tab and make sure that the "Always use HTTPS" option is enabled.

### Generate Origin Certificates

Go to the "SSL/TLS => `Origin Certificates`" tab and click on the `Create Certificate` button. Fill in the form with `RSA (2048)` private key type and click on the `Next` button.

### Save the certificate

After you click on the `Next` button, you will see the certificate and private key.

<Image src={saveOriginSsfCf} alt="Save Origin Server SSL in CloudFlare" />

Create a new files where:

- `Origin Certificate` - Save the certificate to a file with the `cert-vitnode.pem` filename,
- `Private Key` - Save the private key to a file with the `key-vitnode.pem` filename.

Save these certificates, you will need to use the certificate and private key when you configure your server.

### Force HTTPS

Go to the "Rules => `Configuration Rules`" tab and add click on the `Add a rule` button. Fill in the form with the following settings:

- `Name` - vitnode
- `When incoming requests match` - Set to `All incoming requests`,
- `Automatic HTTPS Rewrites` - Set to `On`.

</Steps>

## Server

Now let's configure the server. Go to the [next step](/setup/server) to continue.
